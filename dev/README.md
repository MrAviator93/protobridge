## Latest Compiler

For this library's implementation, I've opted to incorporate the cutting-edge features of C++, specifically targeting the C++23 standard. At the time of this documentation, it's crucial to have access to the most recent stable compiler versions (e.g., gcc-13.2, clang-17.0.3) for successful library compilation.

To facilitate the use of the latest compiler, I suggest several effective approaches:

1. Native compilation of the latest stable compiler release on the intended machine
2. Utilizing Docker to build the compiler, and then transferring the compiled files and associated libraries to a specified environment
3. Operating applications within a Docker container environment, ensuring compatibility with the latest compiler standards
