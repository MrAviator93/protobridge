# BMP180 Example

This example demonstrates how to use ProtoBridge, a versatile IC control and communication library for single-board computers, to read temperature, pressure, and altitude data from a BMP180 sensor over I2C. This code is written in modern C++23, utilizing ProtoBridge's utilities and controllers.

## Requirements

- **Single-board computer** with I2C support (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 5, or any compatible board).
- **BMP180 Sensor** connected to the I2C bus.
