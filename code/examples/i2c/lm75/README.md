# LM75 Example

This example demonstrates how to use ProtoBridge, a versatile IC control and communication library for single-board computers, to read temperature data from an LM75 temperature sensor over I2C.

## Requirements

- **Single-board computer** with I2C support (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 5 or any other board).
- **LM75 Temperature Sensor** connected to the I2C bus.
