## Examples

Understanding how to use the library is key to integrating it effectively in your projects. Below is a practical example demonstrating how you can utilize the LM75Controller to read temperature data from an LM75 sensor.

### Reading Temperature from LM75 Sensor

This example shows you how to initialize communication with the LM75 sensor and read the temperature.

```cpp
// Include I2C library files
#include <i2c/Controllers.hpp>

// Output
#include <print>

int main(int, char**)
{
    // Create a bus controller for the I2C bus (Raspberry Pi 4)
    pbl::i2c::BusController busController{"/dev/i2c-1"};

    // Check if the I2C bus is open and accessible
    if (busController.isOpen()) 
    {
      // Create an LM75 controller, attached to the bus controller,
      // using the default device address
      pbl::i2c::LM75Controller lm75{busController};

      // Read the temperature in Celsius from the LM75 sensor
      auto temp = lm75.getTemperatureC();

      // Check wether the reading is present (indication of successful read)
      if (temp.has_value())
      {
        // Output the temperature to the console
        std::println("Temperature: {}Â°C", temp.value());
      }
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```

This simple program initializes the I2C bus, sets up the LM75 sensor, reads the temperature, and outputs it to the console. By following this structure, you can easily read from other sensors and devices using their respective controller classes provided by the library.

### BLinking LED with MCP23017

This example shows how to use the MCP23017 I/O expander to blink an LED by toggling a GPIO pin every 2 seconds using a software timer.

```cpp
#include <utils/Timer.hpp>
#include <i2c/BusController.hpp>
#include <i2c/MCP23017Controller.hpp>

// Output
#include <print>
#include <thread>

int main( int, char** )
{
 // Default name of i2c bus on RPI 4
 std::string deviceName{ "/dev/i2c-1" };

 // Create a bus controller for the I2C bus
 pbl::i2c::BusController busController{ deviceName };

 // Check if the I2C bus is open and accessible
 if( !busController.isOpen() )
 {
  std::println( stderr, "Failed to open I2C device" );
  return 1;
 }

 // Create an MCP23017 controller, attached to the bus controller
 pbl::i2c::MCP23017Controller mcp{ busController };
 auto pin = mcp.portA().pin( pbl::i2c::MCP23017Controller::Port::Pins::PIN_1 );

 // This API allows us to configure individual pins
 if( !pin.setMode( pbl::i2c::MCP23017Controller::Port::PinMode::OUTPUT ) )
 {
  std::println( stderr, "Error occurred when setting pin mode..." );
  return 1;
 }

 pbl::utils::Timer timer{ std::chrono::seconds( 2 ) };

 while( true )
 {
  timer.onTick( [ &pin ]( [[maybe_unused]] auto dt ) -> void {
   if( !pin.switchPinState() )
   {
    std::println( "Failed to set pin state to ON..." );
   }
  } );

  std::this_thread::sleep_for( std::chrono::milliseconds( 100 ) );
 }

 return 0;
}
```

### Advanced - Pseudo Thermostat Implementation Example

```cpp
class Thermostat
{
 using PIDController = pbl::math::PIDController< float >;

public:
 Thermostat( pbl::i2c::BusController& busController )
  : m_pid{ 0.5, 0.2, 0.25 }
  , m_adc{ busController }
  , m_lm75{ busController }
  , m_thermostat{ busController }

 { }

 [[nodiscard]] utils::Result< void > update( float dt )
 {
  using PIDInput = PIDController::Input;

  return m_adc
   .readDesiredTemp()
   // Step 1: Read the desired temperature from the ADC (returns Result<float>)
   .and_then( [ this ]( float desiredTemp ) -> utils::Result< PIDInput > {
    // Step 2: Try to get the current temperature from the LM75 sensor (returns Result<float>)
    // If successful, combine both temperatures into a PIDInput structure
    // If getTemperatureC() fails, the failure propagates automatically
    return m_lm75.getTemperatureC().transform( [ & ]( float currentTemp ) {
     // If successful, produce a PIDInput with both temps
     return PIDInput{ desiredTemp, currentTemp };
    } );
   } )

   // Step 3: Apply the PID controller to compute the control signal
   .transform( [ this, dt ]( PIDInput input ) -> float {
    // The result is post-processed:
    // - Clamped to [0.0, 10.0] using `Cap`
    // - Squared using `Pow2`
    return m_pid( dt, input ) | pbl::math::Cap{ 0.0f, 10.0f } | pbl::math::Pow2{};
   } )

   // Step 4: Use the control signal to adjust the thermostat (returns Result<void>)
   .and_then( [ this ]( float controlSignal ) {
    // If this fails, the error also propagates
    return m_thermostat.adjust( controlSignal );
   } );
 }

private:
 PIDController m_pid;
 pbl::i2c::ADCController m_adc;
 pbl::i2c::LM75Controller m_lm75;
 pbl::i2c::ThermostatController m_thermostat;
};
```

```cpp

// Include I2C library files
#include "Thermostat.hpp"
#include <utils/Timer.hpp>

// Output
#include <print>

int main( const int argc, const char* const* const argv )
{
 const std::vector< std::string_view > args( argv, std::next( argv, static_cast< std::ptrdiff_t >( argc ) ) );

 // Default name of i2c bus on RPI 4
 std::string deviceName{ "/dev/i2c-1" };

 if( args.size() >= 2 )
 {
  deviceName = args[ 1 ];
 }

 // Create a bus controller for the I2C bus
 pbl::i2c::BusController busController{ deviceName };

 // Check if the I2C bus is open and accessible
 if( !busController.isOpen() )
 {
  std::println( "Failed to open I2C device" );
  return 1;
 }

 pbl::examples::Thermostat thermostat{ busController };
 pbl::utils::Timer timer{ std::chrono::milliseconds( 100 ) };

 while( true )
 {
  auto onTick = [ & ] [[nodiscard]] ( auto dt ) -> bool {
   auto rslt = thermostat.update( dt );

   std::println( "{:12f}", dt );

   if( !rslt )
   {
    std::println( stderr, "{}", pbl::utils::toStringView( rslt.error() ) );
    return false;
   }

   return true;
  };

  if( !timer.onTick( std::move( onTick ) ) )
  {
   break;
  }
 }

 return 0;
}

## Motivation

Diving into embedded systems and single-board computers opened a whole new world for me, one filled with endless possibilities and the sheer excitement of building something tangible. Yet, amidst this excitement, I hit a roadblock. The world of I2C communication was a jumbled mess of libraries, each marching to the beat of its own drum. For someone who thrives on C++, it felt like wading through a sea of mismatched puzzles, all with their own complicated rules. The landscape was cluttered with low-level operations, requiring developers to manipulate bits directly and wrestle with hardware specifics, often leading to frustration and lost time.

What I sought was something clean, something elegantâa single library, written in a consistent style, harnessing the full power of modern C++. I dreamt of something cleaner, more intuitive. A tool that didn't force us to get lost in the weeds with every new IC, but rather, one that cleared the path, making device interaction almost second nature.

That's why I rolled up my sleeves and started crafting this solution myself. I was determined to build a library that wasn't just a showcase of C++ 23's capabilities but also a haven for developers seeking clarity and efficiency. A place where code flows naturally, and modern development feels like a breeze. More than that, I wanted to create a comprehensive package, a one-stop-shop for all kinds of SBC to IC communication, accommodating numerous configurations for various ICs all under one roof.

This library is the fruit of that ambition: a testament to a belief in a world where sophisticated development doesn't have to be synonymous with complexity. It's here to provide a seamless, enjoyable experience for fellow developers, helping them bring their inventive projects to life with less hassle and more confidence.
